Come and fly away with me
Don't you be afraid
Everything will change
You and I
Jumping off the edge
They say dreamers never die
We're rising, we're falling
We'll make it through
We're climbing, we're soaring
A thousand views
Somewhere by the emerald sea
Where the moon and water meet
Somewhere close to harmony
When the world is sound asleep
Something's gonna bring the change
Journeys we are meant to take
Something at the edge of space
Calling us to fly away
